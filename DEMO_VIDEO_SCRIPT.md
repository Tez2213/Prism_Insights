## üìù Script Outline

### Scene 1: Introduction (30 seconds)
**Visual:** Landing page with animated hero section

**Voiceover:**

### Scene 2: The Problem (45 seconds)
**Visual:** Presentation slide or animated graphics

**Voiceover:**
> "MSPs today face four critical challenges: First, they use disconnected tools for profitability, licensing, and sales - creating data silos. Second, they're stuck in reactive mode, only addressing problems after they occur. Third, they're losing 20-30% on hidden costs like underutilized licenses and unprofitable clients. And fourth, they spend hours on manual analysis instead of strategic decision-making. Prism Insights solves all of these problems."

**Actions:**
- Show problem statement slide
- Highlight each pain point
- Show statistics

### Scene 3: Client Profitability Agent (60 seconds)
**Visual:** Client Profitability Dashboard

**Voiceover:**
> "Let's start with the Client Profitability Intelligence agent. Here you can see real-time metrics for all your clients. Notice this client - TechFlow Solutions - has a margin of only 12%, well below our 20% target. Let me ask the AI agent about this."

**Actions:**
- Navigate to Client Profitability dashboard
- Show metrics cards and charts
- Type in chat: "Why is TechFlow Solutions unprofitable?"

**AI Response (show on screen):**
> "TechFlow Solutions has a 12% margin due to three factors: 1) 30% license underutilization costing $2K/month, 2) Technician over-allocation by 15% costing $3K/month, and 3) Two missed upsell opportunities worth $5K/month. I've consulted with the License and Resource agents for a comprehensive solution."

**Voiceover:**
> "Notice how the agent automatically consulted with other agents to provide a holistic solution. This is the power of collaborative AI."

---

### Scene 4: Agent Collaboration (60 seconds)
**Visual:** Continue in dashboard, show collaboration

**Voiceover:**
> "Let me show you how agents collaborate. When I ask for recommendations, watch what happens."

**Actions:**
- Type: "What should we do to fix this?"
- Show AI thinking/processing

**AI Response:**
> "Based on collaboration with all agents, here's my recommendation:
> 1. Reclaim 10 underutilized licenses - saves $2K/month
> 2. Right-size technician allocation - saves $3K/month  
> 3. Upsell managed security services - adds $5K/month
> Net impact: +$10K monthly, margin increases to 28%"

**Voiceover:**
> "The agent analyzed data across profitability, licensing, and resources to provide this comprehensive recommendation. This is impossible with traditional siloed tools."

---

### Scene 5: Software License Intelligence (45 seconds)

> - 15 Microsoft 365 licenses at 30% utilization - reclaim 10 licenses
> - 8 Adobe Creative Cloud licenses unused for 60+ days
> - Slack Business+ can be downgraded to Standard for 12 users

> 2. Global Tech - $32K deal, 70% probability, negotiation stage - address pricing concerns
> 3. StartupXYZ - $28K deal, 65% probability, qualification stage - schedule demo
