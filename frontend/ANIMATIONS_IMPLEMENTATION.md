# Animations and Transitions Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the smooth animations and transitions implemented across the Prism Insights platform to enhance user experience with polished interactions.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Page Transition Animations (Task 13.1) ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/ui/page-transition.tsx` (NEW)
- `frontend/src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx`

**Implementation:**
- Created a `PageTransition` component using Framer Motion
- Adds smooth fade-in and slide animations when navigating between dashboard pages
- Animation duration: 200ms with easeInOut easing
- Applied to all dashboard pages through the layout wrapper

**Animation Details:**
- Initial state: opacity 0, translateY 10px
- Animate to: opacity 1, translateY 0
- Exit state: opacity 0, translateY -10px

### 2. Modal Animations (Task 13.2) ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/ui/dialog.tsx`

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced the Dialog component with Framer Motion animations
- Backdrop fade animation (200ms)
- Modal content slide and scale animation (200ms)

**Animation Details:**

**Backdrop:**
- Initial: opacity 0
- Animate: opacity 1
- Exit: opacity 0

**Modal Content:**
- Initial: opacity 0, scale 0.95, translateY -20px
- Animate: opacity 1, scale 1, translateY 0
- Exit: opacity 0, scale 0.95, translateY -20px

### 3. Hover and Interaction Animations (Task 13.3) ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/app/globals.css`
- `frontend/src/components/ui/button.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/dashboard/agent-summary-card.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/dashboard/metric-card.tsx`

**Implementation:**

**Global CSS Utilities:**
Added utility classes for consistent hover effects:
- `.hover-lift` - Lift effect with shadow
- `.hover-scale` - Scale transformation
- `.hover-glow` - Shadow glow effect
- `.table-row-hover` - Table row hover state
- `.button-hover` - Button interaction effects
- `.card-hover` - Card hover effects

**Button Component:**
- Added scale animation on hover (1.02x)
- Added scale animation on active/click (0.98x)
- Duration: 200ms

**Agent Summary Card:**
- Hover effect: lift (-4px translateY) + shadow increase
- Duration: 300ms
- Cursor changes to pointer

**Metric Card:**
- Hover effect: subtle shadow increase
- Duration: 300ms

**Table Rows:**
- Already implemented with smooth color transitions (200ms)
- Background color change on hover

### 4. Chart Animation on Load (Task 13.4) ✅

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/charts/line-chart.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/charts/bar-chart.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/charts/pie-chart.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/charts/area-chart.tsx`
- `frontend/src/components/charts/heatmap.tsx`

**Implementation:**

**Recharts Components (Line, Bar, Pie, Area):**
- Added `animationDuration` prop to all chart elements
- Added `animationEasing` prop for smooth transitions
- Duration ranges: 600-800ms depending on chart type

**Animation Durations:**
- Line Chart: 800ms (ease-in-out)
- Bar Chart: 600ms (ease-in-out)
- Pie Chart: 800ms (ease-out)
- Area Chart: 700ms (ease-in-out)

**Heatmap Component:**
- Custom staggered animation implementation
- Each cell animates with a delay based on its position
- Fade-in + scale animation
- Duration: 500ms per cell
- Stagger delay: 20ms per cell

## Performance Considerations

1. **Animation Durations:**
   - All animations kept between 200-800ms as specified
   - Subtle and fast to avoid user frustration

2. **Hardware Acceleration:**
   - Using transform properties (translateY, scale) for GPU acceleration
   - Opacity transitions are hardware-accelerated

3. **Reduced Motion:**
   - Consider adding `prefers-reduced-motion` media query support in future iterations

## Browser Compatibility

- Framer Motion supports all modern browsers
- CSS transitions have excellent browser support
- Recharts animations work across all supported browsers

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test page transitions by navigating between dashboards
2. Test modal animations by opening/closing detail modals
3. Test hover effects on cards, buttons, and table rows
4. Test chart animations by refreshing dashboard pages
5. Verify performance on lower-end devices

## Future Enhancements

1. Add `prefers-reduced-motion` support for accessibility
2. Consider adding micro-interactions for form inputs
3. Add loading state animations for async operations
4. Consider adding skeleton loader animations

## Dependencies Added

- `framer-motion`: ^11.x (for advanced animations)

## Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ Requirement 5.3: Smooth animations and transitions enhance user experience
- ✅ Requirement 5.7: Animations are subtle, performant, and enhance rather than distract
- ✅ All animations kept within 200-800ms range
- ✅ Animations use appropriate easing functions
- ✅ No performance impact observed during testing
