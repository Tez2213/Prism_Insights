## Agent Collaboration Framework

### How Agents Work Together

When one agent identifies an issue or opportunity, it can consult other agents for comprehensive analysis:

**Example: Client Profitability Agent detects low margin**
1. **Client Profitability Agent** identifies Client ABC with 12% margin
2. Automatically consults **Software License Agent** â†’ finds 30% license underutilization
3. Consults **Resource Allocation Agent** â†’ finds 15% technician over-allocation
4. Consults **Sales Pipeline Agent** â†’ finds 2 upsell opportunities
5. Provides holistic recommendation: "Optimize by reclaiming licenses ($2K/mo), right-sizing resources ($3K/mo), and upselling services ($5K/mo) = +$10K/mo, margin increases to 28%"

### Collaboration Triggers

**Client Profitability Agent triggers:**
- Low margin â†’ consult License & Resource agents
- High churn risk â†’ consult all agents for retention strategy
- Contract renewal â†’ consult Sales agent for upsell opportunities

**Software License Agent triggers:**
- High license costs â†’ consult Client Profitability for margin impact
- Compliance risk â†’ consult Vendor Management for contract review
- Renewal approaching â†’ consult Spend Analytics for budget approval

**Sales Pipeline Agent triggers:**
- Large deal â†’ consult Resource Allocation for delivery capacity
- Pricing question â†’ consult Client Profitability for margin guidance
- Competitive threat â†’ consult all agents for differentiation strategy
