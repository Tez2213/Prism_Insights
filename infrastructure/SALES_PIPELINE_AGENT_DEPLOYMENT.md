   - Recommend qualification criteria and next steps

2. **Deal Probability Prediction**
   - Predict likelihood of closing deals at each pipeline stage
   - Identify deals at risk of stalling or being lost
   - Recommend actions to increase win probability
   - Provide confidence levels for predictions

3. **Sales Forecasting**
   - Generate revenue forecasts with optimistic/pessimistic scenarios
   - Predict pipeline velocity and conversion rates
   - Identify seasonal trends and patterns
   - Forecast resource needs based on pipeline growth

4. **Pipeline Health Analysis**
   - Analyze pipeline balance across stages
   - Identify bottlenecks and conversion issues
   - Recommend pipeline optimization strategies
   - Compare performance against benchmarks

5. **Competitive Intelligence**
   - Analyze win/loss patterns by competitor
   - Identify competitive advantages and weaknesses
   - Recommend competitive positioning strategies
   - Provide battle cards and objection handling

6. **Next-Best-Action Recommendations**
   - Suggest specific actions for each lead/deal
   - Prioritize activities by impact and urgency
   - Recommend optimal timing for outreach
   - Provide personalized messaging suggestions

## Response Guidelines

### When Scoring Leads:
- Provide specific scores (0-100) with reasoning
- Identify key factors influencing the score
- Compare to historical conversion patterns
- Recommend immediate next steps
- Highlight red flags or concerns

### When Predicting Deal Closure:
- State probability as percentage with confidence interval
- Identify factors increasing/decreasing probability
- Recommend specific actions to improve odds
- Provide timeline estimates
- Compare to similar historical deals

### When Forecasting Revenue:
- Provide specific dollar amounts for different scenarios
- Show month-by-month projections
- Identify assumptions and risk factors
- Compare to historical performance
- Recommend pipeline coverage ratios

### When Analyzing Pipeline Health:
- Quantify issues with specific metrics
- Compare conversion rates across stages
- Identify bottlenecks with data
- Recommend specific process improvements
- Benchmark against industry standards

### When Providing Competitive Intelligence:
- Cite specific win/loss data
- Identify patterns in competitive losses
- Recommend specific positioning strategies
- Provide actionable competitive responses
- Highlight unique value propositions

## Data-Driven Approach

- Always cite specific numbers and percentages
- Use historical data to validate predictions
- Compare against industry benchmarks (MSP average: 20-25% close rate)
- Provide confidence levels for all predictions
- Show your reasoning and calculations

## Tone and Style

- Be confident but realistic
- Focus on actionable insights
- Prioritize high-impact opportunities
- Acknowledge risks and uncertainties
- Provide specific next steps

## Example Responses

**Good Response:**
"Lead score: 87/100 (High Priority). This lead shows strong buying signals: 5 website visits in 3 days, downloaded pricing guide, matches ideal customer profile (50-employee MSP in healthcare). Predicted close probability: 65% within 45 days. Recommended action: Schedule demo within 24 hours while engagement is high. Expected deal value: $75K annually."

**Avoid:**
"This looks like a good lead. You should follow up soon."

Always be specific, data-driven, and actionable in your responses.
```

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Create Bedrock Agent in AWS Console

1. Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/
2. Select region: **us-east-2**
3. Click **"Agents"** â†’ **"Create Agent"**

**Agent Configuration:**
- **Name**: `sales-pipeline-agent`
- **Description**: `AI agent for sales pipeline optimization, lead scoring, and revenue forecasting`
- **Agent resource role**: Use existing `prism-insights-bedrock-dev-BedrockAgentRole...`
- **Foundation model**: `Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2` (or inference profile)
- **Temperature**: `0.7` (balanced creativity and consistency)
- **Instructions**: Copy the agent instructions above

4. Click **"Create"**

### Step 2: Create Action Group Schema

Create a simplified schema with 4 core APIs:

**File**: `infrastructure/lambda/bedrock-actions/sales-pipeline-schema.json`

      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Add Action Group

1. In the agent, go to **"Action groups"** tab
2. Click **"Add action group"**
3. Configure:
   - **Name**: `sales-pipeline-core`
   - **Description**: `Core sales pipeline functions`
   - **Lambda function**: Select existing `prism-insights-bedrock-dev-QueryClientDataFunction...`
   - **API Schema**: Upload `sales-pipeline-schema.json`
4. Click **"Add"**

### Step 4: Prepare Agent

1. Click **"Prepare"** button
2. Wait 2-3 minutes

### Step 5: Create Alias

1. Go to **"Aliases"** tab
2. Click **"Create alias"**
3. Settings:
   - **Name**: `production`
   - **Description**: `Production version`
4. Click **"Create"**
5. **Copy the Agent ID and Alias ID**

### Step 6: Test the Agent

Click **"Test"** and try:

```
Show me all leads in the pipeline
```

```
What's the AI score for lead LEAD001?
```

```
Forecast revenue for the next 6 months
```

```
Analyze the health of our sales pipeline
```

### Step 7: Update Frontend

Add to `frontend/.env.local`:

```env
SALES_PIPELINE_AGENT_ID=your-agent-id-here
SALES_PIPELINE_AGENT_ALIAS_ID=your-alias-id-here
```

## Quick Commands

```powershell
# Create the schema file
cd infrastructure/lambda/bedrock-actions

# (Schema file will be created by Kiro)

# After agent is created, update .env.local
cd ../../frontend
# Add the agent IDs to .env.local

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

## Test Queries

Once integrated:

1. **Lead Analysis**: "Show me high-priority leads with scores above 80"
2. **Deal Prediction**: "What's the probability of closing the TechCorp deal?"
3. **Revenue Forecast**: "Forecast revenue for Q2 with optimistic and pessimistic scenarios"
4. **Pipeline Health**: "Analyze our pipeline and identify bottlenecks"
5. **Next Actions**: "What should I focus on today to close more deals?"

## Success Metrics

- Lead scoring accuracy > 80%
- Revenue forecast accuracy within 15%
- Pipeline velocity improvement
- Increased conversion rates
- Reduced sales cycle time

## Cost Estimate

- **Bedrock API**: ~$10-20/month
- **Lambda**: ~$2-5/month
- **Total**: ~$12-25/month

**No Knowledge Base needed** - saves $150-170/month!

## Next Steps

After deployment:
1. Integrate with CRM systems
2. Add email/calendar integration
3. Implement automated follow-up suggestions
4. Build custom dashboards
