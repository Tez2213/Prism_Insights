# ðŸŽ¯ RUN THIS NOW!

## Your DynamoDB tables are deployed. Now seed them with data!

### Copy and paste these 3 commands:

```bash
cd infrastructure/scripts
npm install
npm run seed
```

That's it! âœ…

---

## What will happen:

1. **npm install** - Installs AWS SDK packages (30 seconds)
2. **npm run seed** - Uploads all your mock data to DynamoDB (1-2 minutes)

You'll see progress like this:

```
ðŸ“Š Seeding clients...
  Found 8 items
  âœ“ Batch 1/1 written
  âœ… Successfully seeded clients table

ðŸ“Š Seeding licenses...
  Found 10 items
  âœ“ Batch 1/1 written
  âœ… Successfully seeded licenses table

... (7 tables total)

âœ… All tables seeded successfully!
ðŸŽ‰ Your data is ready to use!
```

---

## Verify it worked (optional):

```bash
npm run verify
```

---

## That's all! ðŸŽ‰

Your DynamoDB tables now have all the data from your frontend mock files.

**Next:** Create Lambda functions to read this data (see SIMPLE_PLAN.md)
