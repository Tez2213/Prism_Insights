# ✅ DynamoDB Seeding Solution - Ready to Use!

## 🎉 What I've Created for You

I've built a complete seeding solution that reads your frontend mock data and uploads it to DynamoDB.

### Files Created

```
infrastructure/scripts/
├── seed-dynamodb.js      ✅ Main seeding script
├── verify-seed.js        ✅ Verification script
├── clear-tables.js       ✅ Clear data script
├── package.json          ✅ Updated with new scripts
├── README.md             ✅ Detailed documentation
└── QUICKSTART.md         ✅ Quick start guide
```

## 🚀 How to Use (3 Commands)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd infrastructure/scripts
npm install
```

### Step 2: Seed Your Data
```bash
npm run seed
```

This reads all 7 mock data files from your frontend and uploads them to DynamoDB:
- ✅ clients (8 items)
- ✅ licenses (10 items)
- ✅ leads (data from your frontend)
- ✅ technicians (data from your frontend)
- ✅ departments (data from your frontend)
- ✅ vendors (data from your frontend)
- ✅ contracts (data from your frontend)

### Step 3: Verify It Worked
```bash
npm run verify
```

## 📋 Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm run seed` | Upload all mock data to DynamoDB |
| `npm run verify` | Check that data was seeded correctly |
| `npm run clear` | Delete all data from tables (with confirmation) |

## 🔍 How It Works

### The Seeding Script (`seed-dynamodb.js`)

1. **Reads TypeScript Files**: Parses your frontend mock data files
2. **Extracts Data**: Converts TypeScript arrays to JSON
3. **Batch Upload**: Uploads to DynamoDB in batches of 25 (AWS limit)
4. **Progress Tracking**: Shows real-time progress for each table

### Smart Features

✅ **Automatic Parsing**: Handles TypeScript syntax (types, trailing commas, etc.)  
✅ **Batch Processing**: Efficiently uploads large datasets  
✅ **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with troubleshooting tips  
✅ **Progress Display**: See exactly what's happening  
✅ **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times (overwrites existing data)  

## 📊 Expected Output

When you run `npm run seed`:

```
============================================================
🌱 DynamoDB Seeding Script
============================================================
Region: us-east-2
Environment: dev
Table Prefix: prism-
============================================================

📊 Seeding clients...
  Found 8 items
  Writing 8 items in 1 batch(es)...
  ✓ Batch 1/1 written
  ✅ Successfully seeded clients table

📊 Seeding licenses...
  Found 10 items
  Writing 10 items in 1 batch(es)...
  ✓ Batch 1/1 written
  ✅ Successfully seeded licenses table

📊 Seeding leads...
  Found X items
  Writing X items in Y batch(es)...
  ✓ Batch 1/Y written
  ✅ Successfully seeded leads table

... (continues for all 7 tables)

============================================================
✅ All tables seeded successfully!
============================================================

📋 Summary:
  Tables seeded: 7
  Region: us-east-2

🎉 Your data is ready to use!
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "File not found"
**Solution**: Make sure you're in the `infrastructure/scripts` directory

### Issue: "Access Denied"
**Solution**: Check AWS credentials
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

### Issue: "Table not found"
**Solution**: Deploy DynamoDB stack first
```bash
cd infrastructure
cdk deploy
```

### Issue: "Could not parse mock data"
**Solution**: Verify your mock data files follow this format:
```typescript
export const mockClients: Client[] = [
  { id: "1", name: "Client 1", ... },
  { id: "2", name: "Client 2", ... },
];
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

After seeding your data:

### Option 1: Verify in AWS Console
1. Go to AWS Console → DynamoDB
2. Select a table (e.g., `prism-clients`)
3. Click "Explore table items"
4. See your data! 🎉

### Option 2: Verify with AWS CLI
```bash
aws dynamodb scan --table-name prism-clients --region us-east-2 --max-items 5
```

### Option 3: Move to Next Task
According to your tasks.md, the next steps are:
- [ ] 16.2 Create DynamoDB tables (✅ DONE!)
- [ ] 16.3 Create database migration scripts (✅ DONE - seeding script!)
- [ ] 17. Create Lambda API functions (NEXT!)

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Re-seeding Data
If you update your frontend mock data and want to refresh DynamoDB:
```bash
npm run seed
```
It will overwrite the existing data with the new data.

### Starting Fresh
If you want to clear all data and start over:
```bash
npm run clear  # Asks for confirmation
npm run seed   # Upload fresh data
```

### Checking Specific Tables
You can modify `verify-seed.js` to check specific tables or get more details.
