# Software License Compliance Regulations and Best Practices

## Overview

This document provides comprehensive guidance on software license compliance, including legal requirements, industry standards, audit procedures, and risk mitigation strategies for MSPs.

## Legal Framework

### Copyright Law

**United States Copyright Act (17 U.S.C.)**
- Software is protected as a literary work
- Copyright owner has exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, and create derivative works
- Unauthorized use constitutes copyright infringement
- Penalties: Up to $150,000 per work infringed (willful infringement)

**Key Provisions for Software Licensing**
- First Sale Doctrine: Does NOT apply to software licenses (only to physical copies)
- Fair Use: Very limited application to software
- License agreements supersede default copyright rules
- Backup copies allowed under specific conditions (17 U.S.C. ยง 117)

### Contract Law

**License Agreements as Contracts**
- Legally binding agreements between licensor and licensee
- Breach of license terms = breach of contract
- Remedies: Damages, injunctions, license termination
- Enforceability varies by jurisdiction

**Types of License Agreements**
1. **End User License Agreement (EULA)**
   - Click-through or shrink-wrap agreements
   - Generally enforceable if properly presented
   - Must be accepted before use

2. **Enterprise License Agreement (ELA)**
   - Negotiated contracts for large organizations
   - Custom terms and conditions
   - Typically more favorable to licensee

3. **Subscription Agreements**
   - Time-limited access to software
   - Recurring payment model
   - Termination upon non-payment

### International Considerations

**European Union**
- Software Directive (2009/24/EC)
- GDPR implications for data processing software
- Right to interoperability
- Exhaustion of rights (UsedSoft decision)

**Other Jurisdictions**
- WIPO Copyright Treaty
- Berne Convention
- Local copyright laws vary significantly
- Cross-border licensing complexities

## Common License Types

### Proprietary Licenses

**1. Per-User/Per-Seat Licenses**
- One license per named user or concurrent user
- Compliance requirement: Track user assignments
- Risk: Over-deployment (more users than licenses)
- Audit focus: User counts and access logs

**2. Per-Device Licenses**
- One license per device/workstation
- Compliance requirement: Track device installations
- Risk: Software installed on unlicensed devices
- Audit focus: Installation counts and device inventory

**3. Concurrent User Licenses**
- Limited number of simultaneous users
- Compliance requirement: Monitor concurrent usage
- Risk: Exceeding concurrent user limit
- Audit focus: Peak usage monitoring

**4. Enterprise/Site Licenses**
- Unlimited use within defined scope (location, department, etc.)
- Compliance requirement: Adhere to scope limitations
- Risk: Use outside defined scope
- Audit focus: Organizational boundaries

**5. Subscription Licenses**
- Time-limited access (monthly, annual)
- Compliance requirement: Maintain active subscription
- Risk: Continued use after expiration
- Audit focus: Subscription status and payment records

### Open Source Licenses

**Permissive Licenses**
- MIT License: Minimal restrictions
- Apache License 2.0: Patent grant included
- BSD Licenses: Various versions with different terms
- Compliance: Attribution requirements

**Copyleft Licenses**
- GPL (General Public License): Strong copyleft
- LGPL (Lesser GPL): Library-focused copyleft

- Legal fees: If litigation required
- Reputation damage: Difficult to quantify

**Example Scenarios**

*Scenario 1: Minor Over-Deployment*
- 105 users on 100-user license
- Discovery: Internal audit
- Resolution: Purchase 5 additional licenses
- Cost: 5 licenses + no penalty

*Scenario 2: Significant Over-Deployment*
- 150 users on 100-user license
