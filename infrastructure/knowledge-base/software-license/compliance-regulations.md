## Audit Preparation

### Before Audit Notice

2. Maintain accurate inventory
3. Document all licenses and usage
4. Train staff on compliance procedures
5. Establish audit response team

### After Audit Notice
1. Assemble audit response team
2. Gather all documentation
3. Run comprehensive inventory scan
4. Identify and remediate gaps

## Financial Exposure Calculation

### Formula
```
Exposure = (Unlicensed Units × License Cost × Penalty Multiplier) + Legal Fees
```

### Example
- Unlicensed Units: 50 Microsoft 365 E3 licenses
- License Cost: $36/month × 12 months = $432/year
- Penalty Multiplier: 1.5x
- Legal Fees: $10,000

**Total Exposure**: (50 × $432 × 1.5) + $10,000 = **$42,400**

## Remediation Timelines

- Unlicensed production software
- Audit findings requiring immediate action

### High Priority (7-30 Days)
- License shortfalls

- Documentation gaps for major vendors

### Medium Priority (30-90 Days)
