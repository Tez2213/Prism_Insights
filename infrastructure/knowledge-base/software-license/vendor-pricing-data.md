## General Negotiation Strategies

### Timing Strategies

1. **End of Fiscal Quarter/Year**
   - Vendors have sales quotas to meet
   - Best discounts typically available in last 2 weeks
   - Sales reps have more flexibility

2. **End of Calendar Year**
   - Budget flush period for many companies
   - Vendors want to close deals before holidays
   - Good time for multi-year commitments

3. **Renewal Period**
   - 90 days before renewal: Start evaluation
   - 60 days before renewal: Request quotes from competitors
   - 30 days before renewal: Begin negotiations
   - 2 weeks before renewal: Finalize terms

### Discount Maximization Tactics

1. **Multi-Year Commitments**
   - 2-year: Additional 10-15% discount
   - 3-year: Additional 15-20% discount
   - Risk: Locked into pricing and terms

2. **Volume Commitments**
   - Commit to higher license count for better per-unit pricing
   - Negotiate true-up terms for flexibility
   - Risk: Paying for unused licenses

3. **Competitive Pressure**
   - Always have 2-3 alternatives evaluated
   - Share competitive quotes (if allowed)
   - Demonstrate willingness to switch
   - Risk: May need to actually switch

4. **Bundle Purchases**
   - Combine multiple products from same vendor
   - Negotiate enterprise-wide agreements
   - Leverage total spend for better pricing
   - Risk: Vendor lock-in

5. **Annual Prepayment**
   - Pay annually instead of monthly
   - Typical discount: 10-15%
   - Risk: Cash flow impact

### Red Flags in Vendor Pricing

1. **Automatic Price Increases**
   - Watch for clauses allowing automatic annual increases
   - Negotiate caps (e.g., max 5% per year)
   - Require written notice period (90+ days)

2. **Hidden Fees**
   - Implementation fees
   - Training fees
   - Support fees
   - Data migration fees
   - Early termination fees

3. **Restrictive Terms**
   - Auto-renewal clauses
   - Long notice periods (180+ days)
   - Minimum purchase requirements
   - Geographic restrictions

4. **Audit Rights**
   - Unlimited audit rights
   - Short notice periods
   - Broad scope
   - Penalty clauses
