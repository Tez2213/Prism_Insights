## Universal Negotiation Strategies

### 1. The Competitive Bid
**When to Use**: Any renewal or new purchase
**How**: Get 2-3 competitive quotes
**Script**: "We have quotes from [Competitor A] and [Competitor B]. Can you beat their pricing?"

### 2. The Multi-Year Commitment
**When to Use**: When you're confident in the vendor
**How**: Offer 2-3 year commitment for discount
**Script**: "We'll commit to 3 years if you can give us 20% off and lock in pricing."

### 3. The Bundle Deal
**When to Use**: When vendor has multiple products
**How**: Bundle multiple products for better pricing
**Script**: "We'll add [Product B] if you can give us 25% off the combined package."

### 4. The Volume Play
**When to Use**: When you have or expect growth
**How**: Commit to volume increases for better rates
**Script**: "We're at 200 users now, growing to 400 in 18 months. What's your volume pricing?"

### 5. The Timing Leverage
**When to Use**: End of quarter/year
**How**: Wait until last week of period
**Script**: "We can sign this week if you can improve the terms. Otherwise, we'll wait until next quarter."

### 6. The Support Reduction
**When to Use**: When you have internal expertise
**How**: Negotiate lower support tier for savings
**Script**: "We don't need 24/7 support. What's the price for business hours only?"

### 7. The Payment Terms
**When to Use**: When you have cash flow
**How**: Offer annual prepay for discount
**Script**: "We'll pay the full year upfront for 15% discount."

### 8. The Audit Defense
**When to Use**: During or after audit
**How**: Use findings as negotiation leverage
**Script**: "Your audit found $X in violations. We'll settle for 50% and sign a 3-year deal."

## Negotiation Phases

### Phase 1: Information Gathering (Weeks 1-2)
- Request current pricing and terms
- Get competitive quotes
- Analyze usage data
- Identify must-haves vs nice-to-haves
- Set internal budget limits

### Phase 2: Initial Proposal (Week 3)
- Present your ideal terms
- Start 20-30% below budget
- Include all desired features
- Set aggressive timeline
- Request written proposal

### Phase 3: Counter-Offer (Week 4-5)
- Vendor counters with their terms
- Identify gaps and negotiate
- Use competitive pressure
- Bring in decision-maker if needed
- Request "final" offer

### Phase 4: Final Negotiation (Week 6)
- Review final terms
- Negotiate remaining points
- Get everything in writing
- Review with legal
- Sign or walk away

### Phase 5: Post-Signature (Week 7+)
- Verify all terms in contract
- Set up usage monitoring
- Schedule quarterly reviews
- Plan for next renewal

## Common Negotiation Mistakes

### 1. Accepting First Offer
**Mistake**: Signing without negotiating
**Fix**: Always counter, even if offer seems good
**Impact**: Leaving 10-30% savings on table

### 2. Negotiating Too Early
**Mistake**: Starting negotiations 6+ months before renewal
**Fix**: Wait until 60-90 days before expiration
**Impact**: Losing timing leverage

### 3. Not Having Alternatives
**Mistake**: Negotiating without competitive quotes
**Fix**: Always have 2-3 alternatives ready
**Impact**: Weak negotiating position

### 4. Revealing Budget
**Mistake**: Telling vendor your budget
**Fix**: Never disclose budget limits
**Impact**: Vendor prices to your budget, not market

### 5. Ignoring Terms
**Mistake**: Focusing only on price
**Fix**: Negotiate terms, support, and flexibility
**Impact**: Locked into unfavorable terms

### 6. Not Reading Contract
**Mistake**: Signing without legal review
**Fix**: Always have legal review contracts
**Impact**: Hidden fees, auto-renewal, price escalation

### 7. Negotiating Alone
**Mistake**: Single person handling negotiation
**Fix**: Involve procurement, legal, and technical team
**Impact**: Missing important considerations

We're willing to commit to 3 years if you can:
- Match [Competitor] pricing ($X/user)
- Lock in 3% annual increases

Can you revise the proposal with these terms?
